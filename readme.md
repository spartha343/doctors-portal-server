[Live Website](https://doctors-portal-client.netlify.app/ "Go To Doctor's Portal")   ||   [Client Side Code](https://github.com/spartha343/doctors-portal-client 'See server side code in GitHub')

### Features of this website
1. I have integrated stripe to receieve the payments of all the appointments that a user has booked for himself.
2. I have used firebase to authenticate all the users. I have also implemented JWT to secure all the http requests.
3. A client will be able to go through all the available services and book an appointment for himself easily.
4. A user will be able to check all the appointments that he has booked for himself.
5. An admin can add a new doctor dynamically.
6. An admin can also remove a doctor from the database if this is required for some reason.
7. Used MongoDB to store necessary data.
8. Used express.js to develop the backend code.
